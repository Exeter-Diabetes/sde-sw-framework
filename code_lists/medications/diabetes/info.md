# Description

These are lists of dm+d codes for non-insulin glucose lowering medication and insulin.

# Rules

* We check to make sure the date is within the range expected given the data source and patient DOB and death dates.

# Origins

* The codelists were created by searching for generic and brand names (see files) in the SNOMED CT UK Drug Extension RF2 release 41.3.0 and NHSBSA dm+d Release 1.2.0 (both available from NHS TRUD).
