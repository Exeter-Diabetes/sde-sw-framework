# Description

These are lists of dm+d codes for non-insulin glucose-lowering medication and insulin.

# Rules

* We check to make sure the date is within the range expected given the data source and patient DOB and death dates.

* In patients with diabetes, the earliest prescription for a glucose-lowering medication/insulin is used in the algorithm to define diagnosis date - see conditions/diabetes.
 
* In patients with diabetes, being prescribed insulin is used in the algorithm to define diabetes type - see conditions/diabetes.

# Origins

* The codelists were created by searching for generic and brand names (see files) in the SNOMED CT UK Drug Extension RF2 release 41.3.0 and NHSBSA dm+d Release 1.2.0 (both available from NHS TRUD).
