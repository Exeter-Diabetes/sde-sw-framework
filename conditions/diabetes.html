<p>This is a list of codes for diabetes: type 1, type 2 and unspecified
type. It does not include codes for other types of diabetes
e.g. gestational, secondary, monogenic, syndromic.</p>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>We check to make sure the date is within the range expected given
the data source and patient DOB and death dates.</p></li>
<li><p>Presence of one of these codes may not be sufficient to define
diabetes cases. In primary care data, the presence of a diabetes Quality
and Outcome Framework (QOF) code is more specific for true diabetes
cases. In addition, specificity can be increased by removing patients
with codes for other types of diabetes mellitus (gestational, secondary
etc.) or diabetes insipidus, who may erroneously have diabetes mellitus
codes in their records.</p></li>
<li><p>Our algorithm for defining diabetes diagnosis date: the earliest
of a code for diabetes, an HbA1c&gt;=48 mmol/mol (see
investigation/HbA1c) or a prescription for a glucose-lowering medication
(including insulin; see medications/diabetes). It may not be possible to
determine diagnosis dates in some datasets if historical data is not
available. For those with type 2 diabetes, diabetes codes within the
year of birth are ignored. It may be possible to ignore other diabetes
codes which clearly do not relate to diagnosis in some datasets e.g. in
CPRD ignore diabetes codes with obstype=4 as these represent family
history.</p></li>
<li><p>Our algorithm for distinguishing between type 1 and type 2
diabetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No insulin prescriptions: Type 2</li>
<li>With at least one insulin prescription:
<ul>
<li>At least one Type 1 and no Type 2 codes: Type 1</li>
<li>At least one Type 2 and no Type 1 codes: Type 2</li>
<li>Mix of Type 1 and Type 2 codes: if number of Type 1 medcodes &gt;=2
x number of Type 2 medcodes, Type 1, otherwise Type 2</li>
<li>No Type 1 or Type 2 codes: leave as ‘unclassified’. If required, a
probable diabetes type can be assigned as follows: where time to insulin
from diagnosis available: if diagnosed &lt;35 years of age and on
insulin within 1 year of diagnosis, Type 1, otherwise Type 2; if time to
insulin not available: if diagnosed &lt;35 years and not currently
taking a non-insulin glucose-lowering medication (no prescription for a
non-insulin glucose-lowering medication within 6 months, Type 1,
otherwise Type 2.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Since diabetes type is used to inform whether diabetes codes in
year of birth should be excluded or not, this can create a circular
problem in those with no type 1 or type 2-specific codes, where someone
is classified as type 1 if diabetes codes in year of birth are included,
and type 2 if diabetes medcodes in year of birth are excluded (or vice
versa, if time to insulin from diagnosis is affected). These people are
classed as ‘unclassified’, and need further investigation to establish
diabetes type and date/age of diagnosis.</p></li>

<li>The origin of the SNOMED codelist was searching for diabetes and
related codes in the SNOMED CT UK edition release 41.2.0 from NHS
TRUD.</li>
