<p>This repository defines the core diabetes dataset, including
codelists and implementation rules for deriving its components,
alongside code to extract these in a reproducible way. It also contains
information on related projects.</p>

<h2 id="core-diabetes-dataset">Core diabetes dataset</h2>
<p>The core diabetes dataset defines a standardised set of variables
describing diabetes diagnosis, classification, treatment, and key
outcomes, derived from routinely collected health data. It is designed
to support consistent, reproducible analyses across studies by providing
clear variable definitions, validated codelists, and explicit
implementation rules for data extraction and derivation. This dataset
was agreed by expert consensus with input from patients and the public
as defined here [link to paper]. It was developed as part of a <a
href="https://www.southwestsde.nhs.uk/transforming-diabetes-research-south-west-sde-leads-new-projects/">2025-2026
NHS-funded driver project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="codelists">Codelists</h2>
<p>Codelists and algorithms for defining variables in routine primary
and secondary care data (SNOMED, dm+d, ICD10 and OPCS4), as well as
implementation rules, are provided for the components of the core
diabetes dataset and other variables.</p>
