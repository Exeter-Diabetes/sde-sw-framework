Think about standard naming for each variable (e.g. heart_failure) - codelist + rules
Think about version control - keep old ones and have v1 v2 v3

If update any of the codelists for this variable -> new version

## Description
- Rules/algorithms for using heart failure codes - pseudo-code - earliest date of any code - see lists below
- Origin of codes and clinical review and when updated - per list
